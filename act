               Environmental stability and accountability is an important touchpoint for the 20VIC group of companies. Focused on how to create a better relationship with the natural world and protect it from further damage, we set out to create something that was recognizable, memorable and most importantly, a rallying cry around environmental stability. ACT, Always Consider Tomorrow does just that â€“ any ACTion taken today will benefit all of us tomorrow.
